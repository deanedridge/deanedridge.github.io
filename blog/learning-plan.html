I promise to be polite and courtious at all times when communicating with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives

            If things build up and start to get to me I promise I will reach out to my support worker, who is a family member, for guidance and general support and help. I will also reach out to my facilitator for guidance on what is best to do and keep them informed. I will be open and honest with these people and work productively with them.

        A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
        <ul>
          <li class="deans-writing-response">
            I expect the facilitation team to respond to me within 24 hours of a working day to questions or help requests I might have. It would also be good if they encouraged me also.

            I promise to communicate with my facilitator and keep them informed to any appointments I might have or for any reason I might not be available or away from my computer for a long period of time.

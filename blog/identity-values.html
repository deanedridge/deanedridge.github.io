        Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.

            I have been vegan for almost 12 years and I value all life. Some of my values are honesty and kindness. A willingness to give people a second chance at things.

      <li>
        Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.

          <li class="deans-writing-response">
            There was a time when a friend of mine who I had met on Facebook was in an awkward situation as he did not have enough money to buy food or gas to cook food. This friend was in Africa and due to COVID 19 he had no work and was not able to support his family. I didn't have much money, but I knew I was rich compared to him. I wanted to transfer some money to him but I knew things were tight for me as I had many bills to pay. I decided that I would transfer some money to him so he and his family would be able to buy some food and have gas to cook the food.
            
            This was an ethical dilemma for me to make as I myself was in a difficult situation with money at the time, but I realised that my friend in Africa was in a much worse situation than myself so I decided to help him out.

        Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
        <ul>
          <li class="deans-writing-response">
            My values and identity have been influenced by my upbringing and it has given me a culture where I have a high value of life; I believe that all humans are equal. I also believe the saying that goes: If you are going to do something, do it once and do it right.

      <li>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.

          <li>
            Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
            <ul>
              <li class="deans-writing-response">
              My strengths are that I am honest, kind, caring; and empathetic towards others. I like to see things done well. I highly value family and friends. My strengths in learning would be that I have high standards when it comes to the quality of work I produce. One of my limitations would be that I sometimes dig too deep into things and want to be an expert on all matters rather than just being content with what is practical and achievable.

            Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.

                I'm a perfectionist and this may help when it comes to quality control when doing web development during the course. However, being a perfectionist may also be a hindrance when it comes to the time where one needs to accept that, enough time and effort has been spent on this task, and although it may not be perfect, it is time to move on to the next task.

            Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.

                There was a time once where I was trying to work productively with a team of others while completing an engineering project at university. Some of the younger guys had some ideas that they wished to push for the team project, but unfortunately some of these ideas were not that great and would not have worked. The team ended up going with my design and we won the competition. I decided to be assertive and pursuede the team to use my design. In future I would enter into more of a dicussion with the others and encourage them to work as a team for all of us.

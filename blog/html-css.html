    <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>

    <p>When one is new to client-side webdevelopment one will no doubtedly be wanting to learn the basics of layout and formating of web pages. One of the first things one will encounter will be what is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
    </p>

    <p>In order to do this, one must learn something called the box-model, or the CSS box-model. Below is a diagram of the CSS box-model.</p>

    <div id="box-model-image-holder">
      <img id="box-model-image" src="../media/images/boxmodel-detail.png" alt="Diagram showing the CSS box-model">
    </div>

    <p>
      So, if we go from the inside to the outside: first, the padding goes inside the content box; like an old fashioned wooden chest might have padding inside it to pretect its contents from being damaged. Secondly we have the border which is placed on the outside of the content box. Thirdly, on the outside of the border, the margin is placed.
